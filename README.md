# ðŸ“˜ DSA with Java

This repository is a part of my ongoing journey to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. I'm currently learning and practicing consistently, and I will continue updating this repository as I cover more topics and solve more problems.

The goal is to strengthen core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews. All solutions are written in Java, with clean and readable code, and often include comments and explanations.

### ðŸš€ Current Focus
- Learning foundational DSA topics
- Practicing problems from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and other platforms
- Writing optimized and well-structured Java code

### ðŸ”„ Updates
This repository is a work in progress. Content will be added regularly as I explore new topics and solve more problems.

### ðŸ™Œ A Note
If you're also learning DSA or preparing for coding interviews, feel free to explore, learn, and collaborate.
